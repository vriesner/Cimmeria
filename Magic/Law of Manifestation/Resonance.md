Resonance is the ability to use magic in a better way than your opponent because of your connection to the living

[[Harmonist]] is a savant of resonance (Lobos Zuul, Varn, Azriel).
[[Stagnation]] negates resonance

Resonant Adaptation - if you have strong resonance and walk into someplace you can understand it. i.e. A harmonist pyromancer went to khugamiâ€™s domain they would gain ice powers.
