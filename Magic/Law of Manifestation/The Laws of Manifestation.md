The Laws of Manifestation are how mortals use magic. 
[[Resonance]] and [[Embodiment]] are Laws of Manifestation and scales of strength.
Embodiment is self will, kismet and jyorashans are good at this.
Resonance is the ability to use magic in a better way than your opponent because of your connection to the living, khoorans and ryvarrans.
