A recurring natural disaster. 5 major ones have happened. Follows a pattern of a cyclone. Always starts in [[The Depths of Endless Dance]]. People who witness it have their eyes go silver and go mad.
1. [[Tlayopersea Haven]], weak and deflected by [[Elodie Deva]]. 
2. [[Hyperia]], which survived bc of its height but messed with their west and south coasts.
3. Eastern [[Thalvorys]]. 
4. Western Thalvorys, cut completely through [[The Winds of Wealth]] and [[The Nalitan Shores]].
5. Lower [[Jarcosia]] and mountain lands by the [[Cairn]]. 

Jarcosia holds The [[Branding Trials]] to combat against it.
