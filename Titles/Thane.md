> The Thanes have long remained more force than figurehead, though they're worshipped by many. A group of powerful [[Errants]] call these peaks and cragged spires their home. It's said by many who live within [[The Winds of Wealth]] that their existence is what keeps the seas tame and holds back The [[Sea of Endless Dance|Depths of Endless Dance]].
