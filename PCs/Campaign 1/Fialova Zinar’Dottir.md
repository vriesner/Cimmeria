## Backstory

Draped in flowing silver silks that cascaded around her form like liquid moonlight, Fialova watched her mother walk up to the jagged crystal cluster. A delicate veil, dressed with jangling lavender crystals, barely revealed the subtle hint of a captivating purple smile. Fia clambered down the spikes of the crystal as she neared. Silver bracelets adorn her wrists, chiming softly as she reached out to brush her hand over Fia's forehead. She could feel her gentle touch over the sore tissue of her protruding halo.

"Did you have a good day?" her mother asked. "Your father was talking about the progress you have made. He says you are a natural. Soon you will be learning all about the process of alchemic extracting lavender. Are you excited?"

Fialova grabbed her mother's hand as it was offered to her. They walked past the sprawling courtyards - containing beautiful crystal flowers and a massive crystal that stood for communion - and training grounds, where soldiers clad in gleaming armor drilled tirelessly in preparation for the dangers that lurked beyond the Selenic Ring. Civil servants and soldiers bowed their heads in reverence as they passed. She looked up at the earrings adorning her mother's ears as they caught the light in a mesmerizing display. What she could see of her skin, a rich shade of royal purple, seemed to shimmer under the ambient light.

"Fia?"

She blinked as her mother met her gaze. Hesitantly, she said, “I guess. It’s kind of boring, though. It doesn’t really feel all that important-”

“Don’t say that, Fia. It’s very important. Without our alchemists we wouldn’t be able to learn the will of the Mystics,” she scolded. Fialova looked away. She could hear her mother’s sigh as they slowed to a stop. Before the silence could stretch, Fia felt herself be pulled into her mother’s cool embrace. She twisted in her hold and wrapped her arms around her jewel-adorned neck.

At the heart of the fortress lies the central keep, a towering structure of purple crystal. Here, chambers of polished amethyst housed the barracks, armories, and council chambers where the rulers of the bastion convened to discuss matters of defense and strategy.

As they crossed the threshold of the keep, she mumbled, “It just feels like there's more… um, something else? Something else that I want to do. Not that bottling lavender and blessing crystals isn’t the funnest thing…”

Her mother chuckled and let her down, bangles jangling. “Funnest is not a word, bug.”

Fialova shrugged and the two of them walked into the kitchen of the keep. Their ward consisted of a few bedrooms, one that was turned into an office for her father, and a large living space. Being alchemically gifted, her father was prone to making his family meals on his own terms. Usually they relied on maids, but the days when mother was home were special.

At the heart of the kitchen stood a middle-aged man, his skin and halo a striking shade of azure blue. Beside him stood his son; her brother, Hadlee, a young man with skin the color of delicate lilac blossoms and a twisted halo of opal. There was an air of quiet contentment as they moved about the room, their movements deft and practiced. Her father wore a simple apron over his sturdy clothing, the fabric stained with the remnants of countless meals prepared with love and care. Together, they worked in harmony, their laughter and conversation filling the air.

With a long inhale, the scent of herbs and spices filled her lungs, mingling with the aroma of roasting meat and fresh-baked bread. She ran to Hadlee, wrapping her arms around his waist, prattling about the day she had. Her mother sat at the set table, finally flipping her veil back. Fia admired her mother’s prismatic halo and took her seat beside her, listening as the conversation pivoted. She heard, but didn’t really listen, as her mother and father spoke of the ‘Forsaken’ and Hadlee’s upcoming rite of passage.

Fia perked up. “Hadlee’s Descent is tomorrow?”

“It’ll be just you and me for a while, kiddo.” Her father nodded his head and reached over to ruffle her hair.

She smacked his hand away and looked between her parents. They shared a knowing smile as she asked, “Mum’s going too?”

“Someone must guide him,” her mother confirmed.

Fialova sighed and sank in her chair. Without Hadlee around, she’d have no excuses to escape her father’s lessons. Her family continued the conversation, allowing Fia to slink away to her room. The walls were painted in soft shades of pastel pink with delicate butterfly decals fluttering across the walls, wings adorned with shimmering hues of iridescent pinks and purples. In one corner of the room sat a cozy reading nook, nestled beneath a canopy of sheer fabric adorned with twinkling crystal lights. Against another wall stood a sturdy wooden desk, its surface adorned with sparkling crystals of all shapes and sizes. A kaleidoscope of colors danced within each gemstone, casting prisms of light across the room and filling the space with an enchanting radiance.

She touched one of the duller crystals and squinted her eyes as it ignited with brilliant light. There were pages of papyrus covered in ink depicting her family and her dreams. Fialova jumped up on her mattress and exhaled into her pillows. She heard the soft creak of her door opening and glanced over her shoulder to see her mother, now dressed in simpler clothing and less jewelry, step into her room.

Her mother sat next to her and laid her hand on Fialova’s back. “Is anything wrong, Fia? Are you feeling big emotions?”

She turned over to face the woman and grumbled, “I feel off today.”

“And why is that, bug?” There was a pause before her mother added, “Your brother and I will be back in no time. The Mystics and the Lavender will guide us back to safety and rejuvenate us.”

“That’s not it, mum. It’s… about Ione, I guess.”

Her mother hummed in thought. “Did you have a fight?”

Fialova looked up and shook her head. “She said… well, her father never returned from… um, Dulmick?”

There was silence between them. Her mother’s face was stiff as she said, “Duljmik.”

“Aha! That’s it! It was Duljmik.”

Her mother ran her hand up and down her back. She seemed contemplative and remained quiet after Fialova’s confirmation. Then, she reached down to press a kiss to her forehead.

“Ione will need your support,” she told her. Fialova watched her stand up and walk to the table. She tapped the bright crystal with her nail and as the light from the crystal faded and the brilliance of the moon flooded her room, the silhouette from the butterfly on her window shadowed her room. “Sleep well, bug.”

At the heart of the graveyard stood a solitary monument, a towering obelisk of shimmering crystal that seemed to glow from within. It served as a beacon of remembrance, honoring the souls laid to rest in this sacred ground. Carved into its surface were the names of those who have gone before, their memory preserved for eternity amidst the silent embrace of the forest.

In the cold, misted morning, Hadlee’s hand was warm. The crystal trees, with their iridescent foliage, cast dappled shadows upon her family. At her side, Kovidar stood with his shoulders slumped beneath the weight of grief. His eyes, red-rimmed and swollen with unshed tears, were fixed upon the almond-shaped casket before them. With trembling hands, he reached out to touch the smooth surface of the casket, tracing the letters of his wife's name engraved upon its surface.

Zaffre.

Fialova could hear her own wretched sobs escaping from her lips in ragged gasps that filled the forest with their raw intensity. Without a word, her brother wrapped his arms around her trembling form, pulling her close in a silent embrace of solace and support, his own eyes glistening with unshed tears. As her sobs wracked her body, her brother held her tightly, offering her a steady anchor amidst the tempest of emotions that threatened to overwhelm her. His touch was a balm to her wounded soul, his presence a reminder that she was not alone in her pain.

Together, they stood in silent communion, their shared sorrow binding them together in a bond that transcended words. In that moment, as they clung to each other amidst the sea of mourners, they found strength in their shared grief, drawing comfort from the knowledge that they would navigate this journey of loss together, hand in hand.

But amidst the darkness, a glimmer of light shone through – the memory of her mother's love, a beacon of hope that illuminated the path ahead. With a heavy heart and tear-stained cheeks, the girl stepped forward, placing a single purple crystal upon the casket as a final farewell to the woman who had meant everything to her.
